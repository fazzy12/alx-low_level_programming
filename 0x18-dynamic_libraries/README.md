# Dynamic Libraries Project

## Overview
Welcome to the SE Foundations curriculum's Dynamic Libraries project. In this project, you'll dive into the world of dynamic libraries in C programming. You'll learn how to create, use, and manipulate dynamic libraries, as well as explore some advanced concepts like code injection. Let's get started!

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you'll achieve the following:

- Understand the purpose and functionality of dynamic libraries.
- Learn how to create and use dynamic libraries.
- Explore the differences between static and shared libraries.
- Gain practical experience with `C` standard library functions like `nm`, `ldd`, and `ldconfig`.
- Follow secure coding practices and adhere to the `Betty` style guidelines.
- Implement `C` functions callable from Python.
- Utilize code injection to manipulate program outcomes.

## Requirements
To successfully complete this project, ensure the following:

C Tasks
- Use editors like `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`.
- Compile your code with `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- All files should end with a new line.
- Create a header file named `main.h` for function prototypes.
- Avoid global variables.
- Limit each file to no more than 5 functions.
- Do not use standard library functions like `printf` or `puts`.
- Include function prototypes and `_putchar` in `main.h`.
- Follow the `Betty` style guidelines.

Bash Tasks
- Use editors like `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`.
- Test your scripts on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.`
- Ensure files end with a new line.
- Begin each script with `#!/bin/bash`.
- Include a `README.md` with each script explaining its purpose.
- Make all script files `executable`.

## Tasks
`task-0`: A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
Create the dynamic library `libdynamic.so` containing specific functions.

`task-1`: Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
Craft a script, `1-create_dynamic_lib.sh`, that generates a dynamic library from `.c` files in the current directory.

`task-2`: Let's call `C` functions from `Python`
Construct a dynamic library featuring `C` functions accessible from `Python`.

`task-3`: Code injection: Win the Giga Millions!
Leverage code injection to manipulate the outcome of a lottery program.

## Usage
Follow the instructions provided in each task description to complete the corresponding objectives. Compile, run your code, and utilize the provided resources as needed.
